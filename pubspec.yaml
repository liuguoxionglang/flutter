  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/2.jpg
   - assets/images/3.jpg
   - assets/images/4.jpg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
   - assets/images/1.png
   - assets/images/2.png
   - assets/images/3.png
   - assets/images/4.png
   - assets/images/5.png
   - assets/images/6.png
   - assets/images/7.png
   - assets/images/8.png
   - assets/images/9.png
   - assets/config.json

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
